# Privacy Policy for VoiceSkip

**Last updated:** January 13, 2026

## Overview

VoiceSkip is an audio and video transcription application that processes all
data locally on your device. This privacy policy explains how VoiceSkip handles
your data.

## Data Collection

**VoiceSkip does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external
servers.**

All transcription processing occurs entirely on your device using the
whisper.cpp library. No audio, video, or transcription data ever leaves your
device.

## Permissions Used

VoiceSkip requests the following permissions:

- **Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO):** Used to record audio for live transcription.
  Audio is processed locally and is not transmitted anywhere.

- **Media Access (READ_MEDIA_AUDIO, READ_MEDIA_VIDEO):** Used to access audio
  and video files you choose to transcribe. These files are only read for local
  processing.

- **Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS):** Used to display transcription
  progress while the app runs in the background.

- **Wake Lock (WAKE_LOCK):** Prevents the device from sleeping during
  transcription to ensure processing completes.

## Data Storage

- Transcription results are stored only on your device in the app's local
  storage.
- VoiceSkip does not use cloud storage or external databases.
- You can delete all app data by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the
  app.

## Third-Party Services

VoiceSkip does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics
platforms, advertising networks, or cloud services. The app functions entirely
offline.

## Data Sharing

VoiceSkip does not share any data with third parties because it does not
collect any data.

## Children's Privacy

VoiceSkip does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone,
including children under 13.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted
